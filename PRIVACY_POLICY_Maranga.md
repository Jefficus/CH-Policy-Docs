## Maranga: Privacy Policy

Maranga is an innovative new kind of anagramming game, developed by author and word-game-nut, Jefferson Smith, at Creativity Hacker Studios, and distributed through Google Play.

As a self-proclaimed anti-evil activist, I've developed Maranga to maximize fun and minimize the threat to your identity. To that end, Maranga tracks as little data about you as I can manage. 

I hereby state that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, I have not programmed this app to collect *any* personally identifiable information. All data created by you, (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. 

The exception to this, for now, is the archive of previously played games, which are stored elsewhere on the device so that they will remain when the app is uninstalled. This is being done during the testing and development phase to ensure that when users remove one version and install another, they will not lose their saved games. The impact to users is quite small, as even 500 saved games would still consume less than 1 MB of storage space in total. 

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app are as follows:

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` | This is required, for now, to allow saved games to remain on the device in between uninstall-reinstall cycles. This is is scheduled to be removed once the game is released.|
| `android.permission.INTERNET`  `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` | These permissions were required to let Maranga contact our remote server, and update its list of downloadable addons. We intend to retire that feature shortly, and will remove these permission requirements at that time. |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will address it.

Yours sincerely,
